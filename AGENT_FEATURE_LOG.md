# Agent Feature Log

This file is the repository's running implementation history for agent-assisted work.

## Working rule

- Read this file before making any change in this repository.
- After completing work, add a dated entry describing what changed and how it was verified.
- State whether a database migration is required and name it when applicable.
- Keep entries concise, factual, and limited to this repository.

## Entries

### 2026-09-28 - Retest Supabase database connectivity

- Verified the corrected `DATABASE_URL` has the asyncpg driver, complete direct Supabase host, port `5432`, database name, username, and a populated password without exposing secret values.
- Verified the authenticated Supabase API request still succeeds.
- The read-only PostgreSQL check reached connection setup but failed DNS resolution because the direct Supabase database endpoint requires IPv6 in this environment; use the project's Session Pooler connection string for IPv4 access.
- Verification: Supabase API passed; database `SELECT 1` was not reached because direct-host DNS resolution failed.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Validate Supabase connectivity configuration

- Confirmed the ignored local environment contains all three required Supabase variables without exposing their values.
- Verified an authenticated request to the configured Supabase API succeeds.
- The read-only PostgreSQL `SELECT 1` check could not start because the configured `DATABASE_URL` is malformed with an empty port; the URL must be replaced with a complete single-line connection string.
- Verification: Supabase API passed; database URL parsing failed before any database connection was attempted.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Make database configuration Supabase-only

- Removed the local `POSTGRES_*` fallback fields from application settings, `.env.example`, and the ignored local `.env` file.
- Made `DATABASE_URL` the single PostgreSQL connection setting alongside the Supabase project URL and backend secret key.
- Added a regression test confirming that no localhost/PostgreSQL-host fallback remains.
- Verification: 3 pytest tests passed; mypy reported no issues in 29 source files; Python byte-compilation and `git diff --check` passed.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Add local Supabase configuration placeholders

- Added blank `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` placeholders to `.env.example`.
- Created the ignored local `.env` file with the same blank placeholders for developer-supplied secrets.
- Verification: confirmed `.env` exists locally, is ignored by Git, and contains no secret values; `git diff --check` passed.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Establish the FastAPI architecture foundation

- Added the `entities -> app -> interface/infrastructure` package structure based on Shadow's practical clean architecture, adapted for the InkFig domain.
- Added a FastAPI application factory, configurable CORS and `/api/v1` prefix, root and versioned health endpoints, environment template, PostgreSQL-ready dependencies, test/type-check configuration, and architecture documentation.
- Reserved organized locations for DTOs, enums, exceptions, repository ports, services, routes, controllers, dependencies, middleware, SQLAlchemy models, repositories, integrations, and timestamped migrations.
- Verification: 2 pytest tests passed; mypy reported no issues in 29 source files; Python byte-compilation and `git diff --check` passed.
- Migration required: No. The migrations directory is structural only.

### 2026-09-28 - Document the InkFig product vision

- Added `README.md` with the project's university context, art-community purpose, planned discovery and interaction features, AI-assisted image search, teacher event moderation workflow, and access-control direction.
- Clarified that this repository owns authentication, accounts, profiles, roles, permissions, scopes, and account status.
- Verification: reviewed the rendered Markdown structure and ran Git's whitespace validation.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-27 - Initialize agent feature log

- Added this repository-level feature log and established the read-before-work and update-after-work convention.
- Verification: confirmed the file exists in the repository.
- Migration required: No.

## 2026-09-28 - Standardize agent feature log requirements

### Request

Require every repository to use a root `AGENT_FEATURE_LOG.md`, read it fully before each ticket, preserve its history, and append every completed ticket using the prescribed structured sections.

### Changes

- Renamed the existing root feature log to the exact uppercase filename while preserving all previous entries unchanged.
- Adopted the required entry format for this and all future tickets.
- Intentionally left application behavior, authorization, APIs, database configuration, and dependencies unchanged.

### Repositories

- `delivery-main-system`: standardized the root feature-log filename and adopted the structured ticket record.
- `delivery-user-system`: standardized the root feature-log filename and adopted the structured ticket record.
- `delivery-user-FE`: standardized the root feature-log filename and adopted the structured ticket record.

### Files

### Frontend

No frontend changes.

### Verification

- `[passed] git status --short` - confirmed the case-only rename is tracked.
- `[passed] git diff --check`
- `[not run] application tests and builds` - documentation-only filename and log-format change.

### Deployment

No special deployment steps.

### Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `2ce6971`

### Notes

Historical entries retain their original format; the required structured format applies from this entry onward.

## 2026-09-28 - Verify live Supabase connections

### Request

Retest the backend connection after replacing the direct IPv6 PostgreSQL URL with the Supabase Session Pooler connection string.

### Changes

- Performed read-only live checks against the configured Supabase API and PostgreSQL database without printing credentials.
- Confirmed the Session Pooler connection works with SQLAlchemy and asyncpg.
- Removed the temporary diagnostic script after verification.
- Intentionally left runtime application code and configuration values unchanged.

### Repositories

- `delivery-main-system`: verified its local Supabase API and database configuration.
- `delivery-user-system`: verified its local Supabase API and database configuration.

### Files

- `AGENT_FEATURE_LOG.md`: recorded the successful live connection verification.

### API

No API changes.

### Database

No migration required.

### Permissions and scope

- No permissions or roles changed.
- No organization or domain scope changed.
- Backend authorization behavior is unchanged.

### Frontend

No frontend changes.

### Verification

- `[passed] authenticated GET to the configured Supabase REST API root`
- `[passed] SQLAlchemy asyncpg connection through the Supabase Session Pooler`
- `[passed] SELECT 1`
- `[not run] pytest and mypy` - no application source code changed.

### Deployment

- Configure `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and the Session Pooler `DATABASE_URL` in each deployed backend environment.
- No migrations must run before deployment.

### Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `023a33c`
- Push: `successful`

### Notes

## 2026-09-29 - Add AWS SAM Lambda deployment template

### Request

Prepare the InkFig user FastAPI backend for deployment to AWS Lambda using AWS SAM and add a root `template.yaml`.

### Changes

- Added a Mangum adapter that exposes the existing FastAPI application as an AWS Lambda handler.
- Added a SAM template with Python 3.13, x86_64 Lambda, API Gateway HTTP API root/proxy events, tracing, resource tags, and API/function outputs.
- Added deployment parameters for environment, trusted CORS origins, Supabase URL, backend secret key, Session Pooler database URL, and project name; secret parameters use `NoEcho`.
- Added Mangum to backend dependencies and excluded `.aws-sam/` build output from Git.
- Made the existing settings regression test inspect model defaults without loading local secrets.
- Documented SAM validation, build, and guided deployment commands.
- Intentionally left FastAPI routes, authorization behavior, database schema, and custom-domain configuration unchanged.

### Repositories

- `delivery-main-system`: added its Lambda handler, SAM template, deployment documentation, dependency, and focused test.
- `delivery-user-system`: added its Lambda handler, SAM template, deployment documentation, dependency, and focused test.

### Files

- `template.yaml`: defines the user-system Lambda and API Gateway HTTP API.
- `src/lambda_handler.py`: wraps FastAPI with Mangum.
- `requirements.txt`: adds Mangum.
- `tests/test_health.py`: verifies the Lambda handler and avoids loading secret configuration in assertions.
- `.gitignore`: excludes SAM build artifacts.
- `README.md`: documents validation, build, deployment, and parameter handling.
- `AGENT_FEATURE_LOG.md`: records this ticket.

### API

- `ANY /`: API Gateway forwards root requests to FastAPI.
- `ANY /{proxy+}`: API Gateway forwards all nested paths, including `/api/v1/*`, to FastAPI.
- No request fields, responses, filters, validation, permission checks, or application error contracts changed.

### Database

No migration required.

### Permissions and scope

- No application permissions, roles, or access scopes changed.
- Existing and future backend authorization remains authoritative inside FastAPI.
- The SAM template creates only the Lambda execution role required by the serverless function; no domain-specific IAM permissions were added.

### Frontend

No frontend changes.

### Verification

- `[passed] Python YAML compose check for template.yaml`
- `[passed] py -m pytest` - 4 tests passed.
- `[passed] py -m mypy src tests` - no issues in 30 source files.
- `[passed] py -m compileall -q src tests`
- `[passed] git diff --check`
- `[failed] initial py -m pytest` - the pre-existing settings test loaded local `.env` data and was corrected to inspect field defaults without exposing values.
- `[not run] sam validate --lint` - AWS SAM CLI is not installed in this environment.
- `[not run] sam build` - AWS SAM CLI is not installed in this environment.

### Deployment

- Deploy `delivery-user-system` as its own SAM/CloudFormation stack.
- Run `sam validate --lint`, `sam build`, and `sam deploy --guided` on a machine with AWS SAM CLI and configured AWS credentials.
- Provide `CorsOrigins`, `SupabaseUrl`, `SupabaseSecretKey`, and the Session Pooler `DatabaseUrl` during deployment; do not save secrets in committed files.
- No migrations must run before deployment.

### Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `7c278ee`
- Push: `successful`

### Notes

Custom domains and ACM certificates remain follow-up work after the production domains are chosen. The database password appeared in failed test output and must be rotated before deployment.

- No migrations must run before deployment.

### Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `ebefdcc`
- Push: `successful`

### Notes

The old GitHub URL redirected successfully, but the canonical URL is now configured directly.
